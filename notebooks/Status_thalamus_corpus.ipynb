The vigorous Ca 2+ influx in nRt dendrites originating from Ca V 3.3 channels gates SK2 channels, thereby creating a burst afterhyperpolarization (bAHP) [12,19]. As T channels recover partially from inactivation during bAHPs, nRt cells typically generate a series of low-threshold bursts, with a rhythmicity also seen in nRt of sleeping animals [20,21]. In SK2 À/À mice, this oscillatory discharge is replaced by a single burst followed by a slowly decaying plateau potential [10], demonstrating that the cyclical Ca V 3.3–SK2 channel interaction is necessary for nRt rhythmicity. Conversely, genetic overexpression of SK2 channels resulted in increased bAHPs and prolonged cycles of repetitive bursting [13].\\n</td>\n",
