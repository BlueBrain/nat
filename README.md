# NeuroAnnotation toolbox (NAT)

This project is a sprout from the NeuroCurator project which has been divided in a front-end (NeuroCurator) and a back-end (NAT) to provide more flexibility for programmatic interaction with created annotation corpora. This toolbox provides the necessary functions and utilities to reliably annotate the neuroscientific literature, curate published values for modeling parameters, and save them in reusable corpora.
